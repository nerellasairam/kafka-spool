# Overview

This Kafka Connect connector provides the capability to watch a directory for files and read the data as new files are
written to the input directory. The RecordProcessor implementation can be overridden so any file type can be supported.
Currently there is support for delimited files and reading a file line by line.

The CSVRecordProcessor supports reading CSV or TSV files. It can convert a CSV on the fly to the strongly typed Kafka
Connect data types. It currently has support for all of the schema types and logical types that are supported in Kafka 0.10.x.
If you couple this with the Avro converter and Schema Registry by Confluent, you will be able to process csv files to
strongly typed Avro data in real time.

The LineRecordProcessor supports reading a file line by line and emitting the line.

# Schema Configuration

This connector allows you to either infer a schema with nullable strings from the header row, or you can specify the schema in json format.
To use the automatic schema generation set ``csv.first.row.as.header=true``, ``csv.schema.from.header=true``, ``csv.schema.from.header.keys=key1,key2``.
To manually define the schema set ``csv.schema`` to a json representation of the schema. The example below works is for the mock data in the test class.
